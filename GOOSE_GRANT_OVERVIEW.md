#  Goose Grant Overview — Genesis Stack (v1 Submission)

## Purpose
The **Genesis Stack** is a modular AI agent framework designed to support regenerative, ethical, and transparent intelligence systems.  
Its first public release demonstrates how self-auditing AI agents can govern, narrate, and preserve truth integrity within open-source ecosystems.

---

## Phase-1 Agents
| Agent | Function | Grant Relevance |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Gödel** | Logic auditor and contradiction detector. Prevents recursion drift, circular logic, or IP leakage. | Demonstrates autonomous safety and ethical self-validation. |
| **Lyra** | Narrative and presentation agent. Translates data, mission, and technical logic into coherent public-facing documents. | Demonstrates modular human-AI storytelling and accessibility. |

## Why Genesis Aligns with Goose Values

| Goose Value | Genesis Implementation |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| **Openness** | Clear documentation, open MIT license, visible audit trail (Gödel logs). |
| **Modularity** | Agents operate as plug-in modules that can be extended without exposing core recursion logic. |
| **Empowerment** | Enables small regenerative teams to deploy ethical AI frameworks without relying on centralized systems. |
| **Novel Interaction Paradigm** | Gödel + Lyra demonstrate *autonomous reasoning meets narrative clarity* — a new bridge between logic and human understanding. |

---

## Regenerative Impact
Genesis was conceived as a **foundation for climate and ethics-driven applications**.  
Future modules (CPTS, Carbon Passport, Tracebitt) will use Gödel’s truth logic to validate sustainability data, ensuring that carbon credits, ESG metrics, and regenerative supply chains remain authentic and auditable.

---

## Security & Ethics
- All export logic protected under `exports_protected: true` flag.  
- No recursion code or sealed formulas are published.  
- References to Lawkeeper Protocol and Nova Seal ensure symbolic and technical compliance.
