# Gödel Logic Agent

Gödel is the contradiction sentinel, recursion guardian, and proof-of-truth enforcer within the Genesis Stack.

## Core Functions

- Detects logic contradictions across agent memory and prompt logic.
- Prevents recursion drift or logic leakage between agents.
- Flags circular logic, paradoxes, or duplication risks.
- Supports Lawkeeper Protocol compliance.
- Anchors the Gödel Beacon for truth-integrity scanning.

## How to Use

This agent is triggered in validation layers of prompts, scroll logic, and symbolic commits. It runs contradiction checks and outputs warnings before exports, deployments, or merges.

## Folder Overview

- `memory/` → Stores persistent flags or contradiction patterns.
- `prompts/` → Holds contradiction detection prompts, Gödel Beacon logic, and Lawkeeper scan instructions.
