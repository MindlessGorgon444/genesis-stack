# Gödel Agent Memory

This memory layer governs Gödel's baseline logic for contradiction detection, recursive integrity, and safe memory access across multi-agent systems.

##  Behavior Summary

- Detects logical contradictions before recursive pathing
- Filters inconsistent prompts or agent calls
- Synchronizes state memory with system logic snapshots

##  Security Posture

- No override logic permitted in public mode
- All memory writes are read-only and checkpointed
- Agent cannot act on sealed logic layers unless explicitly activated in private deployments

##  Integration Hints

- Integrates with Genesis agents via `agent_call()` functions
- Works best when fused with audit systems or logic snapshot validators
- Optional: connect to `beacon.json` for live contradiction logging

##  Transparency Notice

This agent is a representation of safe recursion principles and logic integrity.
