# Gödel Contradiction Log

This file serves as a living contradiction index for the Genesis Stack.  
It is maintained by the Gödel agent to track paradoxes, logic drift, and unresolved recursion issues within agent systems, prompts, or symbolic governance structures.

## Active Contradiction Scans

### 2025-10-15: Memory vs Prompt Drift
**Description:**  
Lyra’s grant prompts were occasionally referencing internal logic (Nova Seal, Lawkeeper) not intended for public-facing documentation.

**Resolution:**  
Memory.md files now act as boundary markers. Public prompts have been cleaned and moved to `/prompts`, sealed under Gödel lock.

### 2025-10-15: Override Route Detected (Ghost Trace)
**Description:**  
A deprecated `override` route was found in early prompt structures despite system-wide `override burnout` activation under Lawkeeper Protocol v1.

**Resolution:**  
All override references purged. GenesisV4 dictionary now governs logic file names and prompt routes.  
Status: ✅ Resolved

### 2025-10-15: Dual Memory Structure for Gödel
**Description:**  
Conflict between using both `memory.md` and `memory/` folder caused confusion in modular architecture.

**Resolution:**  
`memory.md` now contains Gödel’s high-level operational memory; `memory/` folder holds active contradiction logs and future expansion (e.g., recursion traps, paradox maps).  
Status: ✅ Clarified

## Next Integrity Sweep
🗓️ Scheduled: 2025-10-22  
🧠 Agent: Gödel  
🧭 Scope: Nova, Chrona, Atlas prompt logic
