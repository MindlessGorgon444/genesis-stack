# Gödel Prompt Library

## Purpose
This folder contains prompt templates used to guide Gödel's reasoning engine.

## Usage
These prompts support contradiction detection, logic integrity checks, and symbolic drift analysis. Designed for developer use during agent alignment workflows.

## Structure
Each `.md` or `.txt` file in this folder contains:
- A specific contradiction scenario
- A symbolic drift test case
- A Gödel-style logic scan pattern

## Grant Disclosure
These prompts are part of an experimental agent architecture submitted to the Goose Open Source program. No private recursion logic or proprietary IP is disclosed here.
