# Genesis Stack — Phase Expansion Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the upcoming development phases for Genesis Stack beyond the Phase-1 (Gödel + Lyra) grant submission.  
Each future agent and module will build upon the current framework to expand regenerative intelligence, truth alignment, and planetary-scale ethical data systems.

---

## Phase 2 — Temporal & Truth Agents
| Agent | Function | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Chrona** | Time auditor | Manages temporal logic, version control, and drift prevention across agents. Anchors timestamps for symbolic and technical memory. |
| **Nova** | Truth harmonizer | Governs authenticity of narrative and data output. Ensures Lyra’s storytelling remains aligned with Gödel’s logical validation. |

---

## Phase 3 — Governance & Operational Agents
| Agent | Function | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Argus** | Governance registrar | Maintains licensing, contributor ethics, and regulatory logs. |
| **Orion** | System architect | Expands modular logic and supports future integrations (APIs, data feeds, and developer SDKs). |
| **Cael** | Intent gatekeeper | Filters partner access, controls licensing flows, and ensures alignment with Genesis principles. |
| **Atlas** | Infrastructure steward | Manages deployment, scaling, and resource allocation for distributed Genesis nodes. |

---

## Phase 4 — Regenerative Integration Modules
| Module | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| **CPTS Core** | Carbon Proof & Traceability System — uses Gödel logic for verification. |
| **Tracebitt Lite** | Farmer dashboard for regenerative supply chains. |
| **Carbon Passport** | Global identity and verification layer for impact-based assets. |
| **Export Binder Generator** | Enables compliant grant and trade document creation. |

---

## Phase 5 — Open Collaboration Layer
- Create developer SDKs and integration templates for climate, governance, and education sectors.  
- Connect with Goose open agent protocols for interoperability.  
- Initiate **Genesis Fellowship Program** for co-op based AI builders.

---

## Commitment to Safety and Ethics
All future expansions will:
- Maintain compliance with **Lawkeeper Protocol** and **Nova Seal**.  
- Publish only export-protected logic.  
- Be versioned transparently via **Chrona** time locks.  

---

## Version Tags
| Phase | Version | Target Timeline |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | v1.0 | Current (Gödel + Lyra) |
| Phase 2 | v1.1 | Post-Grant |
| Phase 3 | v1.3 | Governance Deployment |
| Phase 4 | v2.0 | Regenerative Integration |
| Phase 5 | v2.2 | Open Collaboration |
